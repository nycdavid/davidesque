A recent realization that I've had as a father was this idea that I want to preserve the youthful naïvete and 
aspirations that my children have for as long as I can.



# Gear acquisition syndrome

Guitarists all often fall into what I call the "tone trap". We hear our favorite guitarists on our
favorite records play some amazing stuff, and we think "I want to play and sound just like that."

So we try to replicate that guitarist's exact setup. Their guitar, pickups, strings, picks, pedals, etc. we buy it all.
Eventually, we decide we need to have the _exact_ amp that they played in order get the sound from that album. This is
often referred to in the guitar community as "gear acquisition syndrome (GAS)".

I fell into this myself. My favorite guitar player was Zakk Wylde and I slowly amassed everything that he used, but I
still found my tone wanting. Eventually, I convinced myself that it was the amp that was the problem. I needed the exact
amp that Zakk used during the "No More Tears"-era Ozzy albums, a Lee Jackson Metaltronix tube amp head.

The only problem? That album was over 20 years old at that point. They didn't _make_ that amp anymore. I see now on the
Lee Jackson website that the Metaltronix head is actually available for a limited custom order these days. For a cool
__$10,000__.

## Try to DIY it

So what was I to do? Well, I wanted Zakk Wylde's tone and so the only way to get it, in my mind, was to find old
wiring schematics of his amp head (which were available online) and try to build it myself.

In any case, I found these schematics online and, knowing my father was somewhat electrically inclined, showed them to
him while expressing my desire to build this or something like it. He looked at it and actually did recognize some
of the symbols on the wiring schematic like the diodes. He expressed mild surprise at how powerful the amp was and how
loud it had the potential to be. I was excited that he could see something in the diagram that I couldn't, but he followed
that up with a supremely disappointing sentence: "you can't build this. It's too big."

I was disappointed, but not the shallow disappointment that one feels when he quickly realizes that something's impossible.
It was the deeper kind you feel when you've tasted sweet, sweet hope that you might get what you want, before the door
unceremoniously slams in your face.

At the root of it, I think I was feeling a special kind of despair that every young child does at some point: I wanted
to do something, but I just couldn't. And there was __nothing__ I could do about it.

## Sliding scale of ambition vs. realistic expectations

My older son is 5 now. His eyes and imagination are opening up to all kinds of possibilities. I can't read his mind but,
if I could, I'm sure I'd see all kinds of fanciful things that he wishes he could have or experience.

When you think about it, your imagination and desires will never be more ambitious than they are when you're a kid. At 
that age, you're not being realistic. You're just letting your imagination run wild. Then you get older, "realistic
expectations" set in, and you attenuate your goals to be more inline with what the baseline "reality" is for your
surroundings.

The irony lies in the fact that, although ambition starts high in youth, __agency__ is at an all-time low. A kid might
_want_ to build a massive skate park in their backyard but only a select few (if any) have the _means_ to do so: money,
skill, etc. As they get older, agency increases: they get jobs, learn how to do things etc. but they have to trade
away their ambition, since the realistic expectations of the world begin to set in as time passes.

The only real agency that a child has is through their parents. Their parents provide food, buy them things and take them
places. How frustrating it must be for children when they can't just do what they want to do.

So here's an idea: what if I play up that role more?

## Our (adults) role as unblockers

I'm older now and well-established in my career. I have both the money and skill to entertain the ideas and wants that
my kids might communicate to me. 

My wife and I are their only means of getting what they want right now, so what if we enthusiastically took to that role
and actively unblocked their paths so they can do what they need to do?

I want them to go out into the world as adults with enough "headroom" on their ambitions so they'll strive for great things.
And maybe that starts in showing them the wonders of possibility when they're children rather than artificially clamping 
down on it, just to have convenience for myself.

## A dash of realism

Here's the thing: his doubt was __justified__ and __correct__. I mean, the idea that I would be able to take some
random, hand-drawn wiring diagram that I found on the internet and build an exact, functioning replica of a custom amp
head is laughable to me now. I understand my father's dismissal. But that's not __the point__.

The point is that.

He probably has no idea that that had such a profound effect on me all these years later, but I can't blame him. His
parenting style wasn't really the "meet the child where he is" type (neither was my mother's, for that matter) and so
probably didn't really know how to nurture the type of curiosity that I was exhibiting when I brought this project to
him.

But of course, only a few short years later, lots of DIY amp kits started to come out on the market. It was then
I realized, "Wait... so I wasn't crazy. Building my own tube amp IS possible."
