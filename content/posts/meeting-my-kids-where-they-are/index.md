I believe in this idea of "internal programming", where a lot of what you hear from parents and others when you're
growing up forms the basis of what you believe to be possible as you grow older. So if you're discouraged from
certain practices or disciplines, you typically tend to avoid those same things as you make more consequential 
decisions later on in life.

This also has the side effect of capping one's achievements at a certain level. There's the famous story of Dick Fosbury,
the American high jumper who invented the "Fosbury Flop", a technique where a high jumper will clear the bar by leaping
over it, back first.

Once Fosbury's technique debuted, most high jumpers had switched to it within 5 years. That means previous, less optimal
techniques had dominated the sport for decades, and that once the flop became known, the community saw its potential
and adopted the new style, recognizing its superiority and eventually breaking height records.

# Imagination unhindered by "realistic expectations"

A recent realization that I've had as a father was this idea that I want to preserve the youthful naïveté and 
aspirations that my children have for as long as I can.

I see their beliefs as being limitless at this age. In many ways, children are the most innovative members of our 
society because their ideas can blossom in a truly novel way, unfettered by what adults have deemed as 
"reasonable constraints".

In almost all cases, I think it's best for ideas to start in a fanciful, unrealistic form and _then_ be subject to 
real world constraints. That feels like the only way we humans can achieve something truly disruptive. It's much
harder to innovate when we start from a status quo restricted foundation, because the likelihood of "doing things the 
way they've always done" is very high. Children are experts at avoiding this trap because they just don't know what
the status quo is.

# Gear acquisition syndrome

Guitarists often fall into what I call the "tone trap". We hear our favorite guitarists on our
favorite records play some amazing stuff, and we think "I want to play and sound just like that."

So we try to replicate that guitarist's exact setup. Their guitar, pickups, strings, picks, pedals — we buy it all.
Eventually, we decide we need to have the _exact_ amp that they played in order to get the sound from that album. This is
often referred to in the guitar community as "gear acquisition syndrome (GAS)".

I fell into this myself. My favorite guitar player was Zakk Wylde and I slowly amassed everything he used, but I
still found my tone wanting. Eventually, I convinced myself that it was the amp that was the problem. I needed the exact
amp that Zakk used during the "No More Tears"-era Ozzy albums, a Lee Jackson Metaltronix tube amp head.

The only problem? That album was over 20 years old at that point. They didn't _make_ that amp anymore. I see now that the
Lee Jackson website has started to offer the Metaltronix head as a limited custom order these days. For a cool __$10,000__.

## Trying to DIY it

So what was I to do? Well, I wanted Zakk Wylde's tone and so the only way to get it, in my mind, was to find old
wiring schematics of his amp head, which were available online and try to build it myself.

In any case, I found these schematics online and, knowing my father was somewhat electrically inclined, showed them to
him while expressing my desire to build this or something like it. He looked at it and actually did recognize some
of the symbols on the wiring schematic, like the diodes. He expressed mild surprise at how powerful and loud the amp could be. 
I was excited that he could see something in the diagram that I couldn't, but he followed that up with a supremely 
disappointing sentence: "you can't build this. It's too big of a project."

I was disappointed, but not the shallow disappointment that one feels when he quickly realizes that something's impossible.
It was the deeper kind you feel when you've tasted sweet, sweet hope that you might get what you want, before the door
unceremoniously slams in your face.

At the root of it, I think I was feeling a special kind of despair that every young child does at some point: I wanted
to do something, but I just couldn't. And there was __nothing__ I could do about it.

He probably has no idea that it had such a profound effect on me all these years later, but I can't blame him. His
parenting style wasn't really the engaging kind (neither was my mother's, for that matter) and so he probably didn't 
really know how to nurture the type of curiosity that I was exhibiting when I brought this project to him.

But of course, only a few short years later, lots of DIY amp kits started to come out on the market. It was then
I realized, "Wait... so I wasn't crazy. Building my own tube amp IS possible and people out there are doing it."

## Sliding scale of ambition vs. realistic expectations

My older son is 5 now. His eyes and imagination are opening up to all kinds of possibilities. I can't read his mind but,
if I could, I'm sure I'd see all kinds of fanciful things that he wishes he could have or experience.

When you think about it, your imagination and desires will never be more ambitious than they are when you're a kid. At 
that age, you're not being realistic. You're just letting your imagination run wild. Then you get older, "realistic
expectations" set in, and you attenuate your goals to be more in line with what the baseline "reality" is for your
surroundings.

The irony lies in the fact that, although ambition starts high in youth, __agency__ is at an all-time low. A kid might
_want_ to build a massive skate park in their backyard but only a select few (if any) have the _means_ to do so: money,
skill, etc. As they get older, agency increases: they get jobs, learn how to do things, etc. but they have to trade
away their ambition, since the realistic expectations of the world begin to set in as time passes.

Parents act as agentic proxies for their children. They provide food, buy them things, take them places, etc. 
How frustrating it must be for children when they, as humans, just can't do what they want to do. 

I'm certainly not of the mind that kids should be left to their own devices with unlimited means and no boundaries, 
but really think for a second: if you were suddenly rendered helpless and unable to do so much as eat something without 
someone's help, how frustrating would that be?

Isn't it possible that children experience some fraction of that? So here's an idea: what if I play up that role more?

## Our (adults) role as unblockers

I'm older now and well-established in my career. I have both the money and skill to entertain the ideas and wants that
my kids might communicate to me. 

My wife and I are their only means of getting what they want right now, so what if we enthusiastically unblocked their 
paths so they could do what they wanted to do?

I want them to go out into the world as adults with enough "headroom" on their ambitions so they'll strive for great things.
And maybe that starts in showing them the wonders of possibility when they're children rather than artificially clamping 
down on their ambitions, just to have a quiet afternoon for myself.

## A dash of realism

Here's the thing: my father's doubt was __justified__ and __correct__. I mean, the idea that I would be able to take some
random, hand-drawn wiring diagram that I found on the internet and build an exact, functioning replica of a custom amp
head is laughable to me now. I understand my father's dismissal.

As much as it is my role as a parent to show my children what's possible, it's _also_ my responsibility to ensure that
I actively manage their expectations. If my son tells me he wants to be able to grow wings and fly like a bird, it's my
responsibility to (gently) let him know that something like that isn't possible for humans — _not_ to tell him to keep
trying, promising he'll eventually get there. That would be both dishonest and cruel.

However, it doesn't quite end there. I also see it as an important part of my role as his father to listen to him and 
investigate the reason behind the things that he wants. Is there a deeper, intrinsic desire that isn't being met that
I can help him with? Maybe he's curious how flight works? Or where birds go when he sees them migrating away during
cold weather.

The point here is, I want to deepen my relationship with my kids by seeing what's at the root of what they want and 
letting them know that __some__ form of it _might_ be possible. I hope that, by doing that, I can raise happy, curious, 
emotionally intelligent, and imaginative humans.
