title: 'Syncopation == Instant Reggaeton ?!?'

Here's a little music production _tapa_ for you:

I found a neat little trick that gives a boring drum pattern bounce: syncopation. Syncopation is when an unexpected beat 
is emphasized to the listener.

## Before syncopation

The following is a standard, super boring drum beat where the kick plays on every quarter beat of the measure, while the
snare plays on every eighth beat of the measure (except the first beat).

This is pretty boring, and I probably couldn't listen to it for much longer than a bar or 2.

## After syncopation

With a small adjustment of a handful of snare notes, we can change the rhythm to be slightly more interesting (and
give it a _reggaeton_ flare).

Now it sounds like the snare right before the kick is driving the beat and, overall, makes it a more interesting rhythm
to listen to.
