title: 'Series: My Journey in Weight Loss'
---

I've decided to start documenting my journey in weight loss as a way to keep myself accountable and to also keep an 
archive of how it all goes.

My overall goal is probably to get ~150 lbs, but I'm sure that can and will change as time goes on.

Here's my starting point 7 months ago:  225.8 pounds.

# A few notes/guidelines

There are a few tips and tricks that I want to outline here so that they're formalized and can be referred back to:

1. (?) Weigh-in is once a week, on Fridays.
   - I'm not _100%_ sure about this one because I DO kind of see the efficacy of doing weigh-ins more often than that.
   - If the number on the scale isn't decreasing at the rate that I want, it might induce me to re-double my 
     efforts where I otherwise wouldn't have.
   - Up until now I've kind of compulsively weighed myself daily just to see the scale go down, but I'm skeptical about
     the psychological effect that daily measurement has on me.

2. Early to bed, early to rise
   - A very prevalent issue for me is/was snacking at night. I tried all kinds of things to combat it like working in
     the evenings or keeping my hands busy with video games.
   - Bar none, the thing that I've found to be the most effective is setting my alarm for 3:50 AM and waking up super
     early.
   - With this new schedule, I have time to work on things in the morning and the private time that I crave and enjoy,
     but I also get very tired by the 8-9 PM rolls around. This winds up, more often than not, short-circuiting the
     snack loop that I sometimes get into at night.
   - I'm thinking this is one of my __keystone habits__ that I simply just have to keep. As long as I do it, every other
     vital component ends up falling into place.

# The numbers

## 1/12/2026: 197.8

Slight increase, but I think that's to be expected on Mondays. I tend to eat a bit more on weekends because there's 
less structure in terms of what I do. It's a lot of staying home and watching my younger son.

## 1/9/2026: 197.6

All righhhht. Finally getting going here~

## 1/7/2026: 200.2

So much for weighing once a week. I think I just need to do it more often to keep myself thinking correctly. Yes, there
is some feeling bad if my weight doesn't go down, but maybe I need that to keep from indulging in bad habits?

## 1/4/2026: 202.8

I fully expected this weigh-in to come in high, and I was right. I'm fresh off of Christmas break and just eating
whatever I want.

Not a lot to say here, but at this point I just have to trust my process and follow through, everything else should fall into place.
