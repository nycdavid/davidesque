title: 'Endgame'

There's a concept in Chess called the "endgame". This is when there are very few pieces left on the board and the 
game's winner and loser are quite close to being decided.

Because there are so few pieces on the board, both players' strategies tend to change when in the endgame.

I kind of feel like I'm in my own life's endgame as well. I'm well-established in my career, have bought a house, have
children that have either started school or will start school soon and am largely financially secure, barring any truly
idiotic financial decisions. I'm in a very different place than I was in my early 20's where I was hustling to survive
and establish myself. The big problems have been solved and major optimizations made.

The catch is: I'm only 37. Assuming I stay healthy, I have a very long life ahead of me. Thus, questions that I've kinda
deferred for a long time have started to emerge again now that a lot of the noise of life has been cut away:

1. What do I want to do with the rest of my life?
1. How do I want to be remembered?

# The first attempt

I want to pick up the art that I had to put down when I decided to focus on making money and building a family. I would
love to see what kind of success (if any) I can find in the realm of music and songwriting. This is going to take, I 
believe, a tremendous amount of learning and experimentation to accomplish, so I still want to employ my programming
skills to aid in that effort. Maybe I can build something useful in that space as well.

So... the list:

1. Become a music producer with > 1 writing credit to my name.
2. Build out my learning tools ecosystem.
3. Build a blog audience that's following my learning + experimentation.

It starts here, at the end of 2025.
