This series is going to be an investigation into our household budget. We've been using [You Need A Budget (YNAB)](https://www.ynab.com/)
for several years now and I really love it. However, although we've been diligent in our tracking, we haven't been 
_strictly_ adhering to the amount allotted to each category.

If we overspend, we tend to just borrow from the next month, which, in my opinion, goes against the spirit of what
YNAB is all about. 

We also have a couple of "catch-all" categories with names like "Misc." where we just dump all transactions that don't 
really fit in another category. This kind of "lazy accounting", makes it really difficult to sort out which 
purchases should be prioritized, deferred or simply not made at all. It's barely better than not tracking at all 
(but __is__ still better).

Ironically, it's in these catch-all categories that we overspend __the most__.

Thus, I wanted to dedicate this series to using code and data to:

1. Investigate where _exactly_ our money is going.
2. Either adjust our category budget amounts OR curb our spending to the point where we have an accurate number for
   our yearly burn rate.
