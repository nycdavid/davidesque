# Trying to start a band

When I started playing guitar in middle school, I did what most who play instruments do: I tried to find other people 
who liked the same music I did (Metallica, Megadeth and other heavy metal) and start a band with them to achieve my
dreams of rockstar-dom.

I quickly ran into some non-trivial roadblocks:

1. Guitarists/bassists were relatively easy to find, but drummers were near impossible as even a standard kit could be both 
   prohibitively expensive and difficult to store. Parents of teenagers typically try to _avoid_ this.
2. Even if drummers were plentiful, all band members would have to find a way to the drummer's house as attempting to 
   move a kit to another location for practice would be completely impractical.
   - No one had a license at that age and, of the few that do, those with spare vehicles were fewer still.
3. Everyone had varying levels of both dedication and free time. There were many instances where we would try to make
   plans to meet that would just never materialize.

All of this led to a lot of time spent _trying_ to play music with other people but not very much time _actually_ 
playing music.

Eventually, I just gave up. Playing music as an ensemble became something unachievable and eventually just fell by the
way-side and I eventually categorized writing music that was musically complete as something that I would never do.

# It's too much for you to do alone

Things I often heard from adults in my vicinity as I was growing up were:

1. You can't do this yourself.
2. You need a team.
3. That's really ambitious. You need to be more practical.

As I have kids of my own, I've become even more conscious to how much of a blank slate they are and, more importantly,
how many of them inherit limiting beliefs and trauma from their caretakers and adults around them.

# Building my own amp

For a brief time in college, when I was learning guitar and obsessed with finding the amp that would provide me
with "that amazing tone", I convinced myself that building a tube amp from scratch was the only way to get it.

I wanted Zakk Wylde's tone and so the only way to get it, in my mind, was to find old schematics of his amp head and
try to build it myself. Zakk Wylde's work with Ozzy was almost 30 years old at that point, and his old Lee Jackson amp
heads had long been discontinued. It's actually doubtful that they were actually ever on sale to the public and much
more likely that they were a one-off custom build for Zakk himself.

In any case, I found these schematics online and, knowing my father was somewhat electrically inclined, showed them to
him while expressing my desire to build this or something like it. He looked at it and actually did recognize some
of the symbols on the wiring schematic like the diodes. He expressed mild surprise at how powerful the amp was and how
loud it had the potential to be. I was excited that he could see something in the diagram that I couldn't, but he followed
that up with a supremely disappointing sentence: "you can't build this. It's too big."

I was disappointed, but not the shallow disappointment that one feels when he quickly realizes that something's impossible
but the deeper disappointment that's experienced when you have hope that eventually gets extinguished. At the root of it,
I think I was feeling a special kind of despair that every young child does at some point: I wanted to do something but
didn't have the agency to do it.

He probably has no idea that that had such a profound effect on me all these years later, but I can't blame him. His 
parenting style wasn't really the "meet the child where he is" type (neither was my mother's, for that matter) and so
probably didn't really know how to nurture the type of curiosity that I was exhibiting when I brought this project to
him.

But of course, only a few short years later, lots of DIY amp kits started to come out on the market. It was then I realized, 
"Wait, so I wasn't crazy. Building my own tube amp IS possible."
