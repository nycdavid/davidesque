title: 'What are the limits of what one person can do?'
---

Throughout my youth and early adulthood, I had this mistaken idea that if I wanted to do something big, I
couldn't do it alone. I thought I needed a team.

In hindsight, I'm almost 100% sure this was simply a lack of faith in both my skills and ability to learn new things. I
wanted to do something but didn't know how, so I thought I needed someone else to do it with me in order to get started.

Which, I now realize, was total bullshit.

# It's too much for you to do alone

The idea that I need a group to start/do the things I want to do was pervasive when I was growing up. It was like a mind
disease that infected my parents and others around me.

Things I often heard from adults in my vicinity as I was growing up:

1. You can't do this yourself.
2. You need a team.
3. That's really ambitious. You need to be more practical.

As I have kids of my own, I've become even more conscious to how much of a blank slate children are and, more importantly,
how easy it is for them to inherit limiting beliefs and trauma from their environment.

## Trying to start a band

When I started playing guitar in middle school, I did what most people who play instruments do: I tried to find other people 
who liked the same music I did (Metallica, Megadeth and other heavy metal) and start a band with them to achieve my
dreams of rockstar-dom.

I quickly ran into some roadblocks:

1. Guitarists/bassists were relatively easy to find, but drummers were near impossible as even a standard kit was both 
   prohibitively expensive and difficult to store. Also, really, really loud. It was like the trifecta of things that
   parents hate. Being a older and a parent now, I __totally get it__, but it was a real impediment for us back then.
2. Even if drummers had been plentiful, all practice and jam sessions would have to happen __at the drummer's house__. 
   No one's trying to disassemble a kit and transport it elsewhere so their band can practice for 2 hours, just to have 
   to move it back. Totally impractical.
    - Furthermore, no one really has a license at that age and, of the few that did, those with spare vehicles were fewer still.
3. Everyone had varying levels of both dedication and free time. There were many instances where we would try to make
   plans to meet that would just never materialize because of reasons. 
   - A typical band would be _at least_ a three-piece, but usually more. Trying to wrangle 5 schedules and find a sliver
     of free time in that impossible intersection would be enough to make anyone not bother.

I found myself spending a lot of time spent _trying_ to play music with other people but not very much time _actually_ 
playing music.

Eventually, I just gave up. Writing music with other people became something unachievable and eventually just fell by the
way-side. I eventually filed "writing & playing music" in the folder of things that I would just never do. It never
occurred to me to just start by myself.

# Fast-forward to today

I'm not sure if any of those limitations in the past were real. Maybe it simply was the case that, without a lot of
money or connections, a single person was highly limited in terms of what they could do alone.

But it's not true today. Information on the internet, LLMs and automation have given single individuals tremendous
amounts of leverage compared to my father's era. Sure, the tools can be awkward to both use and connect together, but
they represent oceans of opportunity for those persistent enough to try and keep trying.

# So what will I do with this information?

Put simply, I want to address my inner child. The same child that felt helpless and lacked the agency to start 
something on his own because he felt like he needed a team or that he needed someone to say "Yes" to him. I want to 
give him the agency to be both the person that says "Yes" and the recipient of that "Yes".

Eventually, I also want to place that same agency into the hands of my 2 boys. I want to break the cycle of 
intergenerational trauma and helplessness and hand something down to them that I can be proud of and that they can use. 
I'll do so with money, access and a conscious effort to present them with the possibility that they can do anything
they want.
