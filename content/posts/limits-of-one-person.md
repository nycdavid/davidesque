# Trying to start a band

When I started playing guitar in middle school, I did what most who play instruments do: I tried to find other people 
who liked the same music I did (Metallica, Megadeth and other heavy metal) and start a band with them to achieve my
dreams of rockstar-dom.

I quickly ran into some non-trivial roadblocks:

1. Guitarists/bassists were relatively easy to find, but drummers were near impossible as even a standard kit could be both 
   prohibitively expensive and difficult to store. Parents of teenagers typically try to _avoid_ this.
2. Even if drummers were plentiful, all band members would have to find a way to the drummer's house as attempting to 
   move a kit to another location for practice would be completely impractical.
   - No one had a license at that age and, of the few that do, those with spare vehicles were fewer still.
3. Everyone had varying levels of both dedication and free time. There were many instances where we would try to make
   plans to meet that would just never materialize.

All of this led to a lot of time spent _trying_ to play music with other people but not very much time _actually_ 
playing music.

Eventually, I just gave up. Playing music as an ensemble became something unachievable and eventually just fell by the
way-side and I eventually categorized writing music that was musically complete as something that I would never do.

# It's too much for you to do alone

Things I often heard from adults in my vicinity as I was growing up were:

1. You can't do this yourself.
2. You need a team.
3. That's really ambitious. You need to be more practical.

It's become increasingly more interesting to me, as I have children of my own, how much of a blank slate they are and,
in turn, how many of our limiting beliefs and trauma we tend to pass on to them.
