title: 'The creative process is a dirty tap'
---

I’m mildly (to put it mildly) obsessed with the creative process. I really enjoy writing music, but the circumstances of my life are such that I don’t get to do it very often. I have both a family and a full-time job in tech that take up the lion’s share of my time.

That being said, there’s a feeling when I write songs that I can’t quite elucidate: it’s mild but I can only really describe it as some kind of “creation high”, where I feel like I’ve written something that someone (not me) might actually enjoy. Like maybe I’ve gotten a fleeting glimpse at what pro song writers might be capable of.

Being able to write something that I can actually enjoy might not seem like much, but don’t be deceived. It’s actually a really big deal because I’m *highly, highly* self-critical.

# I’m my own harshest critic

It’s true. I, by and large, hate a lot of what I create.

Ok, so *hate* is probably a strong word but of the few songs that I wrote during my very brief stint in music production in my late 20s, there aren’t very many that I’d want to listen to again today. They always sound more amateurish and less catchy than the artists that I actually enjoy listening to.

Does this ever change for artists? I was always deathly afraid of a paradox that I made up/might have heard about somewhere else, which is:

> The curse of the artist is that everyone enjoys their work **except them.**

# Maybe that paradox is made up (I hope…)

Doing a quick search on reddit, I found a topic named “[Do artists listen to their own music?](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/1dapi5b/do_artists_listen_to_their_own_music/)”

The consensus seems to be **Yes, they do!** For a few different reasons that seem obvious now. Here are a few standouts that resonated with me:

> I make the exact kind of music I want to listen to, so yeah I fucking rock!

> If YOU don't like your own music, why should anyone else? You're literally making the music you want to hear, nothing wrong with listening to that.

Of course, a few people mentioned burning out on a song they wrote because they had to listen to it a million times during the writing and mixing process.

This has definitely happened to me in the past while writing music but, thinking back, it feels like the musical backbone of those particular songs were weak. In other words, when I was working on a song that didn’t feel particularly inspired, I burnt out on it quick. I didn’t particularly bond much with the music and it just ended up being another bad track.

In hindsight, those songs should never even be published. I think, maybe, the bad songs just need to get out. No need to let anyone hear them. Just let them pass so you can get back to writing the stuff you like.

# Writing the universe/God/your muse

Sometimes you’re doing something creative, having shit luck and not producing anything particularly good. BUT THEN! You stumble on to an amazing and absolutely inspired paragraph or melody or scene and it feels like, for a split second, you were able to channel a stroke of genius that produced something awesome.

I call this “writing the universe” because it feels like something otherworldly has put its hand on yours for a moment and penned something tremendous. Something you always hoped to be capable of weren’t quite sure you were yet?

And the best part? You like it. I mean you *really, really* like it. It’s catchy and hits all the notes and themes you had in mind. It evokes the imagery you wanted, in exactly the way you wanted it.

It’s like that scene in the movie Limitless where down-on-his-luck writer Eddie Morra takes the NZT pill for the first time and the movie, after being all blue and washed out, gets all bright and orange, signaling that sunny days are here now.

He cleans his rundown, old, heroin-chic apartment and, in a few hours, bangs out the rest of the manuscript for the book he owes his editor.

# The come down

In my experience, no one can write the universe for long. There’s always the come down. This is that next day, after you experienced that seconds/minutes/hours-long fugue state of artistic bliss. You sit back down at your desk, DAW at the ready, pen and paper in hand and you try to reproduce yesterday’s magic.

And what comes out? Utter **trash**. It’s not happening anymore! Compared to yesterday’s orange optimism, well this is just pale, drab blue again. You try to do the same things you did yesterday. Maybe I touched the bookshelf before closing the the door when I should have closed the door first and *then* turned on the lamp? If I could just *remember the ritual* from yesterday, I can get back to work and write nothing but masterpieces from here on out!

Alas, you try and try, but nothing works. Before you know it, the day is shot and none of what was produced is usable. You’re dejected. You thought for sure that you had opened the door to artistic excellence and slammed it shut on creative mediocrity.

# The dirty tap

My belief/hope is that this cycle of producing bad work with sprinklings of good work is just the normal way that creative pursuits unfold.

Ed Sheeran can speak on this better and with more authority than I can. In one of my favorite [video interviews of him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDyg_41QF1w), he likens song writing to a “dirty tap” (faucet for us non-UK folks). He states that:

> You view it as a dirty tap. When you switch a dirty tap on, it’s going to flow shit water out for a substantial amount of time and then clean water is going to start flowing. And now and then you’ll get a bit of shit but as long as it gets out of you, it’s fine.

He goes on to explain that the more you write and experience, the less occurrences of “shit water” you get flowing from your faucet.

# Having faith (?)

I’ve hardly any experience beyond a handful of aborted attempts in this field so I can only really hold on to the hope that the thing I’m theorizing here is real and not some incarnation of survivorship bias. The only thing I can do is pretend. And then act. Otherwise colloquially described as the “fake it til’ you make it”.

The only contingency I haven’t planned for is: what if I don’t make it? What then?

I think the “question to the question” is: what does “making it” actually mean? This is where moving the goal posts is actually a good thing. If I can move from one meaningful goal to another when it seems like the original goal was unrealistic or not what I imagined it be, I can still win.

So the real question: how will I reframe my world at that point in time to still provide myself with a sense of accomplishment? Luckily, I don’t have to decide that now.
