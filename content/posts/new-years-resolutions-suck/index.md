# Gyms are empty by February

I'm sure everyone has heard about the phenomenon where gyms are packed in early January, when everyone's fresh off 
their New Year's resolution highs. 

I can attest to this. There's a huge dopamine hit from loudly declaring that you're about to pursue a goal that you've 
had on your list for a long time, even if that declaration is to yourself.

But then, come February, a significant portion of that New Years crowd has thinned out, no longer able to muster the 
same motivation they had 1 month prior.

This post isn't necessarily about that or to shame those people. Motivation and consistency come in waves, so I don't 
believe a broken chain is some big tragedy. I'm more of the mind that if folks fall seven times, they should get up 
eight.

# Why put significance on a date?

I was never one to get truly caught up in this "cleansing, new year, new me" farce peddled by New Years Resolution 
advocates.

I don't know why any significance or meaning has to be placed on January 1st at all. It's just a day. This particular 
one comes around every year and there are 365/366 of them just like it.

There are inevitable missteps on the journey to accomplishing something great. The path to success is hardly 
(read: never) linear. Mentally inflating the importance of one day as some kind of starting gun for that journey seems
to always make those inevitable missteps even more painful.

Someone's alone on New Years? If it were some random night in June, who would say anything? Sure, being together with
your loved ones is _always_ preferred but why is it made to feel worse when it's on New Years Eve?

New Years day is coming up? Let's make a resolution and make it some huge, ceremonial affair such that when someone ends
up missing a day at the gym (which they __will__), it's a colossal failure in proportion to the fanfare with which the 
goal was made.

# Make any old day your day 1

Just pick a day and make that the day you started. The more random the better. What about March 19th? Or September 5th?

Dispel all notions that the day you start something is some big, tremendous ribbon cutting event and, instead, start
quietly but assuredly. Don't beat yourself up when you inevitably lose your streak because you got sick, or you were sad,
or work took over your life and just __get back up__.

# The rolling window

Forget about January 1st as being "THE DAY" you started.  Instead, how do your past 7 days look? Past 2 weeks? 
Past month? They look okay? Good, keep it up. Are they not looking too good? That's okay too. Make today your day 1 
and start again.
