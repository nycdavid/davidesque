This series will be an ongoing collection of my notes exploring the ins and outs of Kubernetes controllers.

I'll do my best to polish these into bite-sized posts ideal for reader consumption. I can't promise that they'll be 
exhaustive, but I can promise that they'll be _practical_ and, hopefully, you'll end up having learned at least as much 
as I have.
