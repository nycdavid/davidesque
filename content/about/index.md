title: 'What is this blog about?'
---

Good question. This blog doesn't yet have a single focus. Maybe it never will, but I _am_ interested in a handful of things:

1. Writing code (I'm a software engineer by trade). Specifically:
   - Golang
   - DevOps technologies: Kubernetes, Argo family of products, etc.
   - General homelabbing and home automation systems
2. Listening to, playing and writing music.
   - I started playing guitar in middle school and recently (at the ripe age of 37) bought an electronic drum set to teach myself drums.
3. I really like movies and any other mediums (video games, television, etc.) that are capable of delivering a compelling narrative.
   - Media that uses great music is particularly impactful for me and leaves a lasting impression. 
   - Examples of this would be:
     - The [Facemash scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnSW8xOd0A&t=70s) from The Social Network set to the OST track "In Motion" by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.
     - The use of Rush's "Tom Sawyer" in the [trailer for The Iron Claw](https://youtu.be/8KVsaoveTbw?si=IScfSgnZAD2FC609&t=52) and the way they integrate a minor key.
     - Anadel's "Remember Me" during the [credits of episode 3](https://youtu.be/Ov0vtJHPKqY?si=AJp4DJST7yxjjPdp) of Telltale Games' The Walking Dead (Season 2)
4. Personal finance, investing and FI/RE, although I'm not quite sure what I would write about here that hasn't already been said...
5. Being a good parent and raising my 2 sons as productive, capable members of society (who don't hate me).

Expect this list to change but these are my interests today. At the very least, I hope this blog can serve as some kind of time capsule for future generations of my family.
